# MCAP Library and Applications

## Summary 
The library is a simple build wrapper around the Foxglove MCAP file libraries. 
Its purpose is to test the MCAP files capabilities. The MCAP may be used instead of
the MDF file in use cases where the write speed is of importance.

The following use cases will be tested.

- Bus Logging (CAN and ADAS).
- Converting MDF files to MCAP files. Visualize with FoxGlove.
- Temporary message cache streaming.

The library is currently under development.
